The protein is believed to accumulate in the mitochondria and the cytosol. It affects CSD2 (At2g28190 - a superoxide dismutase) transcript levels and may play a role in the response to oxidative stress. One member of the family (ACO1 - At35830) was shown to specifically bind to the 5' UTR of CSD2 in vitro. ACO3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and its phosphorylation state is modulated in response to ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds.","ACONITASE 3 (ACO3)"," ",17,21,0,0,0.041373978,0.039275579,0.062944139,0.074549869,0.085964247,0.102438472,0.129487147,0.147978529,0.1544994,0.161488639,0.033959542,0.043749957,0.042512693,0.056486632,0.071493945,0.089731897,0.163686261,0.177832759,0.137084959,0.183461356

SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.","VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711)",Vacuole,4,4,0,1,0.371555832,0.162985022,0.114407381,0.108165994,0.074266867,0.056228933,0.039347541,0.030797096,0.026126234,0.0161191,0.340049873,0.216059692,0.118270063,0.080466629,0.063792506,0.069545423,0.069697061,0,0.026644434,0.015474319

AT3G60190,"At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central `dynamin 2` domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.","DYNAMIN-LIKE 1E (DL1E)"," ",11,13,0,0,0.109599666,0.111374762,0.111134808,0.115248812,0.098043407,0.093280796,0.092332096,0.089052369,0.088266558,0.091666729,0.112314536,0.123604299,0.122162909,0.120716854,0.109870372,0.096064684,0.077131847,0.086461474,0.080345798,0.071327228

AT5G11390,"Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.","WPP DOMAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (WIT1)"," ",9,10,0,0,0.064023629,0.089069333,0.125297295,0.129047734,0.121501139,0.120206286,0.083423428,0.105203554,0.076098427,0.086129175,0.04663693,0.09399393,0.107792,0.1177178,0.1163564,0.1019301,0.1514986,0.1279231,0.0610084,0.07514275

IBR3 is hypothesized to carry out the second step in a  &#946;-oxidation-like process of IBA metabolism in Arabidopsis.  Though its subcellular location has not been determined, IBR3 has a peroxisomal targeting  sequence and  two other putative IBA metabolic enzymes (IBR1 and IBR10)  can be found in this organelle. No specific enzymatic activity has been  documented for IBR3, but double mutant analyses with CHY1 argue against a role for IBR3 in general fatty  acid &#946;-oxidation.","IBA-RESPONSE 3 (IBR3)"," ",4,4,0,0,0.052712202,0.061859428,0.096764421,0.09975312,0.103356817,0.081360948,0.142928172,0.126050551,0.113429531,0.121784808,0.03840024,0.05705993,0.06629792,0.08126847,0.08018053,0.09243395,0.2215296,0.09642328,0.1313023,0.1351038
