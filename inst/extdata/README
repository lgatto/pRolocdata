** Table S3 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc4.xls
Protein correlation profiles for each measured protein from three
different sets of experiments: high and low-density sucrose gradients,
and cytoplasm versus nucleus. In each worksheet the IPI and UniProt
codes, as well as protein names and measured abundances (expressed as
log10[ion intensity]), are listed before the normalized abundances of
each protein in each 2 fraction. The high-density page contains ion
intensities for only the first eight fractions (Fr01-08) while the
low-density page contains information for fractions 09 through 30
(Fr25-29 were not included as they are equivalent to Fr30).

Each worksheet has been opened in gnumeric and saved as a csv file.

Peptide correlation profiles for each measured peptide from three
different sets of experiments: high and low-density sucrose gradients,
and cytoplasm versus nucleus (three separate worksheets). In each
worksheet the charge state, molecular weight and amino acid sequence
of each peptide precede the measured ion volumes (in Da). The
high-density page contains ion intensities for only the first eight
fractions (Fr01-08) while the low-density page contains information
for fractions 09 through 30 (Fr25-29 were not included as they are
equivalent to Fr30).

** Table S5 -- PIIS0092867406003692.mmc6.xls
Localizations for all proteins measured in this study. IPI and UniProt accession codes, protein descriptions, abundances and the number of peptides upon which the localization was based are listed in the first five columns of each sheet. In the Localizations Sheet the subsequent columns contain the χ2 values for that protein’s PCP versus the marker for the given organelle where the protein met the assignment criteria (see Experimental Procedures). Where the assignment criteria were not met (e.g., where the χ2 value was higher than the cutoff) no value is shown. The fold enrichments for proteins in the nucleus are indicated in the Cytoplasm/Nucleus column (only those proteins enriched more than two-fold). In the Refined Locations Sheet the result of evaluating our measured localizations versus the published literature is shown (see Experimental Procedures). 'Yes' was assigned where annotation indicated the protein was in the organelle but also in the case where secreted proteins were identified in the secretory pathway (ER, ERGDV, Golgi). 'No' was assigned where the measured location was not among the annotated locations for a protein. 'Probably' was assigned in several instances: 1) where no location was otherwise annotated, 2) where a protein annotated as cytosolic was measured in an organelle since it would encounter than organelle and could be specifically associated with it, 3) where a protein annotated as nuclear was found in the cytosol since most proteins are not completely excluded by the nuclear pore, 4) where a non-proteasomal protein was found in the proteasome since most proteins are degraded by this machinery at some point, 5) where cytoskeletal proteins were measured in an organelle. 'Co-migrating' was assigned for ribosomal proteins that peaked in fractions 17 and/or 19.

Marker proteins have been extracted from the paper, second paragraph on page 188:

To determine the PCP of well-studied organelles, we
examined the profiles of several well-characterized
marker proteins, including 130 kDa Golgi phosphoprotein
(GPP130, Golgi), AP-2 assembly subunit AP17 (plasma
membrane [PM]), early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1, early
endosomes [EE]), transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2, recycling
endosome [RE]), calnexin (ER), p115 (ER/Golgi-derived
vesicles [ERGDV]), and F1-F0 ATP synthase b subunit (mi-
tochondria). Each of these markers peaked in different
gradient fractions and had distinct profiles; thus at least
these seven organelles could be distinguished with confi-
dence (Figure 2B). Markers of other compartments were
also observed, but their profiles matched closely to one
of the seven mentioned above. In particular, ERGIC-53,
a marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment,
overlapped very closely with the ER, as has been reported
previously (Breuza et al., 2004). Likewise, the profiles of
cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and
adaptor-related protein 1b, markers of the late endosome
and trans-Golgi network, respectively, largely overlapped
with TfR2 (Tables S3 and S4). This suggests that these
compartments migrate similarly in rate-zonal centrifuga-
tion and is in agreement with the specialized conditions re-
quired for even partial segregation reported by others
(Tulp et al., 1998; Hashiramoto and James, 2000).

Organelle marker had a chi2 scores of 0 for the expected organelle, except where otherwise noted:

original markers.

The two following csv files contain Uniprot ID and Entry Names for the
the proteins that appear in the above 3 datasets. This information has
been downloaded from www.flymine.org using the 'list analysis' tool
using the protein CG numbers as input.

TanFlyMineFiltered.csv
TanFlyMineUnfiltered.csv

The filtered dataset contains only Uniprot IDs that have been reviewed
i.e. that come from Swiss-Prot. Some CG numbers give rise to more than
one reviewed Uniprot ID. The unfiltered dataset contains all Uniprot
IDs per CG number which includes corresponding IDs from both
Swiss-Prot (reveiwed) and TrEMBl (unreviewed), again some CG numbers
have multiple IDs. Four columns have been added to the Tan MSnSet
instances to include this information which are called
ProteinAccession, EntryName, ProteinAccessionAll and
EntryNameAll. ProteinAccession contains a single Uniprot accession ID
per protein, for proteins with multiple Uniprot IDs the ID which is
reveiwed appears here, if none are reviewed (or multiple are reviewed)
the ID that appears first in the csv file for that protein is
used. The column ProteinAccessionAll contains all UniprotIDs per
protein (both reviewed and unreviewed). Similarly the columns
EntryName and EntryNameAll conatin the Uniprot entry names for each
protein with EntryName containing only one name and EntryNameAll
containing all names per protein.

Proteomics data provide unique insights into biological systems,
including the predominant subcellular localization (SCL) of proteins,
which can reveal important clues about their functions. Here we
analyzed data of a complete prokaryotic proteome expressed under two
conditions mimicking interaction of the emerging pathogen Bartonella
henselae with its mammalian host. Normalized spectral count data from
cytoplasmic, total membrane, inner and outer membrane fractions
allowed us to identify the predominant SCL for 82% of the identified
proteins. The spectral count proportion of total membrane versus
cytoplasmic fractions indicated the propensity of cytoplasmic proteins
to co-fractionate with the inner membrane, and enabled us to
distinguish cytoplasmic, peripheral inner membrane and bona fide inner
membrane proteins. Principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbor
classification training on selected marker proteins or predominantly
localized proteins, allowed us to determine an extensive catalog of at
least 74 expressed outer membrane proteins, and to extend the SCL
assignment to 94% of the identified proteins, including 18% where in
silico methods gave no prediction. Suitable experimental proteomics
data combined with straightforward computational approaches can thus
identify the predominant SCL on a proteome-wide scale. Finally, we
present a conceptual approach to identify proteins potentially
changing their SCL in a condition-dependent fashion.

Compartmentalization of biological processes and the associated
cellular components is crucial for cell function. Typically, the
location of a component is revealed through a co-localization and/or
co-purification with an organelle marker. Therefore, the
identification of reliable markers is critical for a thorough
understanding of cellular function and dysfunction. We fractionated
macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells, both in the resting and
endotoxin-activated states, into six fractions representing the major
organelles/compartments: nuclei, mitochondria, cytoplasm, endoplasmic
reticulum, and plasma membrane as well as an additional dense
microsomal fraction. The identity of the first five of these fractions
was confirmed via the distribution of conventional enzymatic
markers. Through a quantitative liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of the fractions, we identified
50-member ensembles of marker proteins ("marker ensembles") specific
for each of the corresponding organelles/compartments. Our analysis
attributed 206 of the 250 marker proteins ( approximately 82%) to
organelles that are consistent with the location annotations in the
public domain (obtained using DAVID 2008, EntrezGene, Swiss-Prot, and
references therein). Moreover, we were able to correct locations for a
subset of the remaining proteins, thus proving the superior power of
analysis using multiple organelles as compared with an analysis using
one specific organelle. The marker ensembles were used to calculate
the organelle composition of the six above mentioned subcellular
fractions. Knowledge of the precise composition of these fractions can
be used to calculate the levels of metabolites in the pure
organelles. As a proof of principle, we applied these calculations to
known mitochondria-specific lipids (cardiolipins and ubiquinones) and
demonstrated their exclusive mitochondrial location. We speculate that
the organelle-specific protein ensembles may be used to systematically
redefine originally morphologically defined organelles as biochemical
entities.

Goblet cells specialize in producing and secreting mucus with its main
component, mucins. An inducible goblet-like cell line was used for the
purification of the mucus vesicles stored in these cells by density
gradient ultracentrifugation, and their proteome was analyzed by
nanoLC-MS and MS/MS. Although the density of these vesicles coincides
with others, it was possible to reveal a number of proteins that after
immunolocalization on colon tissue and functional analyses were likely
to be linked to the MUC2 vesicles. Most of the proteins were
associated with the vesicle membrane or their outer surface. The
ATP6AP2, previously suggested to be associated with vesicular proton
pumps, was colocalized with MUC2 without other V-ATPase proteins and,
thus, probably has roles in mucin vesicle function yet to be
discovered. FAM62B, known to be a calcium-sensitive protein involved
in vesicle fusion, also colocalized with the MUC2 vesicles and is
probably involved in unknown ways in the later events of the MUC2
vesicles and their secretion.

Dear Laurent,

the organelle data is in:

Y:\RAW\pvs22\_QTOF_DATA_data3\synapter2paper\final_scripts\for_laurent

there are three folders there each corresponds to one of the pipelines
used for quantitation: for synapter synapter 1 (proloc_s1), for
synapter 2 (proloc_s2), for synapter 2 with 0 fragments specified
(proloc_s2_0F).

Each of the folders contains a csv file with protein quantitation
called protTableCI.csv. (CI stands for "common identifications") this
is proteins shared between all three pipelines.

The folder also contains common markers. Please let me know if you
need anything else. Just for you reference there is an R script there
which I used to compare the F1 values. I tested it today and
everything seems to work, i.e. file is loaded markers added, svm
optimisation performed. Good luck with your analysis!

** Mouse neuron Intensity and LFQ data

- Tab 1: Mouse neuron raw intensity data
- Tab 2: Mouse neuron LFQ maps data
- Tab 3: Marker proteins with norm data
- Tab 4: Notes (below)

This worksheet contains the new mouse neuron proteomic data generated
in this study. Tables correspond to the primary output from MaxQuant;
only basic filtering was applied to remove reverse hits, proteins only
identified by site, and common contaminants. For the various analyses
presented in the manuscript, further quality filters and normalization
steps were applied, as detailed in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.

Intensity data correspond to the raw MaxQuant output, for all five map
replicates, and include cytosol, membrane and nuclear fractions, as
well as two full proteome samples.

LFQ data are the MaxQuant LFQ (label free quantification) normalized
intensities of the (five times) six membrane fractions used for
generating organellar maps.

** Marker proteins with norm data

The 834 compartment marker proteins used for classification. LFQ
values were normalised to a sum of 1 ('normalised area data') within
each map, to generate abundance distribution profiles suitable for SVM
based machine learning.

Label-free quantification is performed across 22 fractions where each experiment
has 3 replicates. There are 3 experiments in total low-fat diet, High-fat diet after
3 hours and high-fat diet after 12 hours. Maxquant was used to pre-process the
data. These files provide the raw quantitation data, but normalised data
is provided within the
MSnSet.
