  Protein and PMS-level hyperLOPIT datasets on Mouse E14TG2a embryonic
  stem cells from Christoforou et al. (2016).

}

\description{
  This is a spatial proteomics dataset from a hyperLOPIT experimental
  design on Mouse E14TG2a embryonic stem cells.
}

\usage{
data(hyperLOPIT2015)
data(hyperLOPIT2015ms3r1)
data(hyperLOPIT2015ms3r2)
data(hyperLOPIT2015ms3r3)
data(hyperLOPIT2015ms2)
data(hyperLOPIT2015ms3r1psm)
data(hyperLOPIT2015ms3r2psm)
data(hyperLOPIT2015ms2psm)
}

\format{
  The data is an instance of class \code{MSnSet} from package
  \code{MSnbase}.
}

\details{
  This is a hyperLOPIT experiment. Normalised intensities for proteins
  for TMT 10-plex labelled fractions are available for 3 replicates
  acquired in MS3 mode (\code{hyperLOPIT2015ms3r1},
  \code{hyperLOPIT2015ms3r2} and \code{hyperLOPIT2015ms3r3}) using an
  Orbitrap Fusion mass-spectrometer. The first two replicates have also
  been combined as described in Trotter et al (2010) to generate dataset
  \code{hyperLOPIT2015} to increase organellar resolution. A dataset
  acquired in MS2 mode has also been acquired (\code{hyperLOPIT2015ms2})
  which was also generated using the Orbitrap Fusion and using a TMT
  10-plex experimental design.

  The PSM-level cvs file are available in the \code{extdata} directory
  and have been processed as follows: imported \code{MSnSet} instances
  using \code{readMSnSet2}, PSMs with missing values were filtered out
  with \code{filterNA}, only PSMs with feature variable
  \code{Quan.Usage} \code{"Used"} and a TMT6plex modification were
  retained and the phenoData was matched and assigned from the
  respective protein-level data. Finally, marker proteins are annotated
  based on the combined protein-level data \code{hyperLOPIT2015} and
  reporter tags are normalised using the \code{"sum"} method. The
  processing script is \code{scripts/hyperlopit2015psm.R}.
